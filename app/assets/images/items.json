Also the asset pipeline gives assets a seed in the name. this is A to break the local cashe of the user's browser but it is also to make sure all files have a unique name. on pre-compile (that you run in production) a yaml file is created in the app linking the generated files to the original path. This allows for quick linking from in-code naming to compiled asset name. This at the same time avoids the duplicate name issues.",

Does anybody know how I can accomplish something like this? I know that's kind of a sloppy way to organize my code, but this is just a quick little hack I'm putting together.

Thanks!",
